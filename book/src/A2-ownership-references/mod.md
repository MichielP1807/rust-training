## A2.1 Move semantics
*This exercise is adapted from the [move semantics exercise](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/tree/main/exercises/move_semantics) from Rustlings*


This exercise enables you to practise with move semantics. It works similarly to exercise `A1.1`. To get started, `exercises/A2/1-move-semantics` in your editor and run
```bash
cargo run --bin 01
```

Make all exercises compile. For some of them, extra instructions are included as doc comments at the top of the file. Make sure to adhere to them.


## A2.2 Borrowing

Fix the two examples in the `exercises/A2/2-borrowing` crate! Don't forget you
can run individual binaries by using `cargo run --bin 01` in that directory!
Make sure to follow the instructions that are in the comments!
