layout: with-footer

# What Rust brings


- **Multi-purpose** <span class="light">Build high-quality software, from cloud embedded and systems</span>
- **Core strenghs** <span class="light">"C-like" performance, with memory safety and modern ergonomics</span>
- **Confident developers** <span class="light">SO's most admired (loved) language for 8 years in a row</span>
- **Momentum** <span class="light">Adopted by big tech: Chromium, Linux & Windows kernels</span>

# Are there downsides too?

Sure there are. The things mentioned most often:

- **Steep learning curve** <span class="light">Getting *productive* with Rust takes relatively little time, though</span>
- **Relatively new ecosystem** <span class="light">Do your research before getting started</span>
- **Compiling large projects can be slow** <span class="light">Similar to template-heavy C++</span>
